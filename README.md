# OpenRepeater Webapp
This is the GUI Application for the OpenRepeater project. By itself it does nothing. It requires a number of other dependencies and is built around a single board computer environment. This is more of a home for developers to update and share code. To get started with OpenRepeater, please visit [OpenRepeater.com](https://openrepeater.com) where you can download a precompiled image with everything you need to get started.
